The goal of Cup is to create some order in the chaos that is managing and communicating Git repository project structure.

## The Problem

As your projects grow, so likely does the number of contributors and if you're onto something the demand for your product.
Managing the organization of Git repositories as they grow can be a big challenge.

The liklihood is, your repositories contain a whole host of application and configuration code.
- Some of it will be directly responsible for the function of your end-product
- Some might define non-functional requirements (observability, security and networking)
- Some will configure what to build, how to test and where to distribute

Every organization manages this chaos differently, and Cup respects that.
What Cup aims to do is give you the tools to codify your style, automate the busy work, and improve discoverability.

While there are a lot of intricate and important details in your repositories, the likelihood is there are some higher-level kinds of resources that are ultimately being described.

- Databases
- Services
- Features
- Clusters

## The Solution

Cup allows you categorize and expose these resources through a consistent, declarative and self-describing API.

But what does this mean?

### Consistent

The API is consistent from one resource kind to the next.
Retrieving, searching, updating and removing should be the same for a service as it is for a logical feature or database.

Retrieval, update and removal requires instances of each kind to be uniquely addressable (group, version, kind, namespace and name).
Search and cataloguing requires a taxonomy on which to organize and facet discovery (groups, namespaces and labels).

### Declarative

The API expresses resources through a logical representation of _what_ is contained in the repository, as opposed to _how_ it is stored.
The _how_ is defined inside **controllers**, where you can extend Cup to suit your layour and format requirements.

Controllers combine the state of the Git repository at a particular reference, with a desired state of a resource to calculate a difference to be proposed via a pull or merge request on a target SCM (GitHub, Gitea etc.).

### Self-describing

Each resource has a structured schema, which can be requested via the API.
This schema can be used by external tools in order to present meaningful interfaces or enable further automation to be built.

## What's next

In order to achieve this, there are a few core concepts that come together to make Cup what it is.

1. [Resource Definitions](/concepts/definitions)
2. [Controllers](/concepts/controllers)
3. [Bindings](/concepts/bindings)
