Because Git deserves better contribution automation
</Callout>

Cup is an extensible server for building automation around contributions to Git and SCMs like GitHub.
It exposes a consistent declarative API, with an opinionated convention based on Kubernetes.
The API is self-describing, allowing for tooling to be developed with broad applicability to a range of usecases.
All changes made to API resources are handled by Controllers. Controllers do the heavy lifting when it comes to changing the contents of a repository based on the desired state of an API resource. Any calculated changes are proposed as pull or merge requests on your prefered SCM (GitHub, Gitea etc.).
